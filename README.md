Every week i get dozen of messages with people asking me to make a roblox clone for them. I dont make roblox clones. So i made one for them to use.

#### Is this free?
100% Free, only condition is to credit me, or not at all, just dont go around saying you made it.

#### How customizable is this?
I wanted to make this as customizable as possible, on `config.js` you can find all what you can easily configurate.
You could also edit the source code of the frontend etc... it is really easy.

#### Do you have a Discord?
Yes we do!
